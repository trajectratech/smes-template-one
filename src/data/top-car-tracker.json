				},

				{
					"question": "How much does it cost to put a tracker on a car in Nigeria?",
					"answer": "The cost of installing a car tracker in Nigeria varies based on several factors—most notably the features, quality of the device, and after-sales support. These elements play a major role in determining the final price. For example, the MTN car tracker typically costs between ₦40,000 and ₦60,000, but it also comes with recurring renewal fees. At Top Car Tracker Nigeria, we offer a more transparent and affordable option. All our standAll our standard tracking plans are one time payments no renewal fees whatsoever (except for fleet management packages)."
				},

				{
					"question": "Where is the best place to put a tracking device on a car?",
					"answer": "We can’t reveal the exact best spot to place a car tracking device, as that goes against our professional ethics. However, there are a few important things to consider when deciding where to install one. The most important is keeping the device well hidden so it’s not easily found or removed. At the same time, it should be placed where it can get a strong signal to transmit data reliably."
				},

				{
					"question": "What stand you out in other car tracking company in Nigeria?",
					"answer": "What makes us different is that we’re the first car tracking company in Nigeria — and even Africa — to launch an app built on blockchain technology. TopCarTrackerNigeria is active in all major cities across the country, which makes us more accessible and responsive than most competitors. Our recovery rate for stolen vehicles is unmatched. With a success rate of around 98%, we also don’t charge a single naira to help clients recover their car."
				},

				{
					"question": "Do you have any car tracking device with no monthly fee?",
					"answer": " Looking for a car tracking device with no monthly fees? Worry no more, if you’re a private car owner or managing a small fleet (under 10 vehicles), you’re in luck — we don’t charge any renewal fees or monthly subscriptions. Only our fleet management plans come with a renewal fee, and that’s simply because they require more storage and server resources."
				},

					"question": "Does a car tracker work when the car is off?",
					"answer": "Yes, a car tracker works even when the car is off. It has a backup battery and stays active to monitor your vehicle’s location."
